Uber_Trips_Analysis usoing pyton 

By analyzing Uber trips, we can draw many patterns like which day has the highest and the lowest trips or the busiest hour for Uber and many other patterns. The dataset Iâ€™m using here is based on Uber trips from New York, a city with a very complex transportation system with a large residential community.

The dataset contains data of about 4.5 million uber pickups in New York City from April to September and 14.3 million pickups from January to June 2015. You can do so much more with this dataset rather than just analyzing it. But for now, in the section below, I will take you through Uber Trips analysis using Python.
