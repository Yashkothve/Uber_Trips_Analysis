Uber_Trips_Analysis using pyton 

By analyzing Uber trips, we can draw many patterns like which day has the highest and the lowest trips or the busiest hour for Uber and many other patterns. The dataset Iâ€™m using here is based on Uber trips from New York, a city with a very complex transportation system with a large residential community.

The dataset contains data of about 4.5 million uber pickups in New York City from April to September and 14.3 million pickups from January to June 2015. You can do so much more with this dataset rather than just analyzing it. But for now, in the section below, I will take you through Uber Trips analysis using Python.


So this is how we can analyze the Uber trips for New York City. Some of the conclusions that I got from this analysis are:

Monday is the most profitable day for Uber
On Saturdays less number of people use Uber
6 pm is the busiest day for Uber
On average a rise in Uber trips start around 5 am.
Most of the Uber trips originate near the Manhattan region in New York
